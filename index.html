                <h3>Final Summary: Looking Back and Looking Forward</h3>
                <p>
                    Engaging in the problem-solving process has been an enriching experience, offering valuable insights into user experience, ideation, and solution implementation. Initially, I identified a personal problem with the Oakville Transit App, recognizing its broader implications for my daily routine and well-being. This problem, coupled with observations from interviews and online ethnography, allowed me to understand the multifaceted nature of user experiences and frustrations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the process, I learned the importance of framing the problem effectively, as evidenced by the "How might we" statement and Point of View (POV) statement. These tools provided clarity and direction, guiding my brainstorming towards relevant and impactful solutions. Employing divergent thinking techniques allowed me to explore a wide range of potential solutions, covering various aspects of the issue. This approach encouraged inclusivity and collaboration, ensuring that all ideas were considered and recorded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In evaluating and selecting the most promising ideas, I prioritized user-centric solutions that directly addressed identified needs and frustrations. This criteria ensured that the selected ideas aligned with the problem statement and were feasible within the context of Sheridan College's student center platform. By considering factors such as impact, feasibility, and user-centrality, I was able to identify solutions with the potential to significantly enhance the system's reliability and user experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One area for improvement in my process could be to further explore the feasibility and implementation details of selected ideas. While I outlined potential solutions, such as establishing a dedicated online support team, I could delve deeper into the practical steps required to prototype and test these ideas effectively. Additionally, incorporating user feedback more comprehensively throughout the process could enhance the relevance and effectiveness of proposed solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moving forward, the skills and insights gained from this problem-solving process will undoubtedly influence my approach to future projects. I recognize the importance of empathy, creativity, and iterative testing in driving meaningful innovation. As I embark on the final project in this class, I will apply these lessons learned, ensuring a thoughtful and user-centric approach to problem-solving. By leveraging a combination of data-driven insights, divergent thinking techniques, and user feedback, I aim to develop solutions that address real-world problems effectively and ethically.

        </h1>
        <h2>Activity 1:Spotting a Problem  in the Real World</h2>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <p>
            <br>Pick a location to observe in your community. It could be a park, grocery store, workplace
            <br>, during your commute, or even within your home. Look for a problem that is complex and 
            <br>ambiguous and would be a good candidate for a problem-solving methodology. 
            <br><br>Record what takes place when you notice the problem. 

        </p>
        <h3>What to post?</h3>
        <p>
            <br>Describe your observations, along with proof that you've done the activity (a picture of your 
            <br>handwritten field note, your transcript, a picture of the issue, etc.). Refrain from identifying 
            <br>specific individuals and strive to preserve confidentiality. Include the following: 
        </p>
        <p>
            • Who experiences the problem
            <br>• Where and when you witnessed the problem
            <br>• Why do you think it is a problem worth solving
        </p>

        <h2>My Observation</h2>
        <h3>Who experiences the problem?: Me</h3>
        <h3>Where and hen did you witness the problem?: Before heading to the campus and before heading back home.</h3>
        <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            The Oakville Transit App is an app published by Oakville Transit. It isn't a navigation app but a bus-tracking app which I find difficult to <br>
            understand how it functions even though I consider myself to be quite tech-savvy (frontend developer background and I'm also a tech <br>
            lover). This app took a lot longer than I would like to get used to but that is not a major problem, the major problem for me lies in the fact<br> 
            that even though the bus tracking feature of the app works fine most of the time. The estimated arrival time of the bus is not consistent <br>
            at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is supposed to show the estimated arrival time for the selected stop, but from time to time it will not show the estimated arrival<br> 
            time of the next bus even though after checking an official schedule from Oakville there are supposed to be more buses arriving at<br> 
            the time. This causes me anxiety, frustration, and time during planning the commute. Especially, during this winter semester when exposure<br>
            to unnecessary cold air can cause many health problems which can affect my academic performance.<br>

        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think problem is worth solving</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, I think this problem is worth solving because it can cause many health problems which can affect my academic<br>
            performance. Solving this problem will help improve my anxiety during travel along with my workflow since I don't have to spend too<br>
            much time researching and switching between too many applications. Solving this problem can also help prevent the risk of getting sick<br>
            due to exposure to low temperatures during this winter semester.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I chose this particular problem because I find this problem to be quite significant in terms of improving my daily life routine, workflow,<br>
            and help decreasing the risks of getting sick in a specific season.<br>

        <h1>Unit 2:
            <br>Understanding the Problem
        </h1>
        <h2>Activity 1: Conducting Interviews</h2>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare an open-ended question to encourage storytelling and potential follow-up prompts.</li>
            <li>Partner up with someone in our class. Ask for their consent to conduct an interview.</li>
            <li>Conduct the interview, actively listening and probing for deeper insights.</li>
            <li>Record key quotes, observations, and noteworthy points.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What to post?</h3>
        <p>
            Note the key insights gained from the interviews, including direct quotes when possible. This can be in text form, or an image of sticky notes/handwritten notes.
        </p>

        <h2>My Interview Findings:</h2>
        <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Can you tell me about your experience using Sheridan my student center?</li>
            <li>What part of the website do you find to be the most frustrating or most convenient?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The student's experience with the Sheridan Student Center was largely negative, characterized by several issues. Firstly, residents were given priority in the selection processes, leading to dissatisfaction among non-resident students. Additionally, frequent shutdowns of the tab system caused frustration. Difficulty in accessing classes with friends heightened anxiety levels. Suggestions for improvement included a more accessible UI design and better management of web traffic. Overall, the student identified a need for increased fairness, reliability, and usability within the Sheridan Student Center.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I find the experience of conducting a semi-structured interview to be a bit difficult, I think it requires quite a bit of communication skill to be able to extend or dive deeper into a participant's personal answer.
The interview shows the participant’s perspective on the subject matter and might show a new way or approach that might lead to a better human-centric way to counter or handle the problem.

        <h2>Activity 2: Online Ethnography - Memes and Posts</h2>
        <p>
            Utilizing online posts, memes, and other primary content is a valuable strategy in the design process. By exploring digital platforms, we tap into a vast pool of user-generated content that reflects diverse opinions, sentiments, and cultural nuances related to the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <p>
            Search online for memes, posts or comments related to the identified problem. This should be primary content, meaning it is not an article or published resource.
        </p>
        <h3>What to post?</h3>
        <p>
            Post 2-3 screenshots of memes or posts that provide insights.

            <br>Prototyping
        </h1>
        <h2>Activity: Developing a Prototype or Testing an Idea</h2>
        <p>
            We prototype or test ideas to gain tangible, real-world insights into the viability, user experience, and potential challenges of a concept. This iterative process allows us to refine and optimize solutions, ensuring they effectively address user needs and perform well in practical scenarios.
        </p>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose one of the selected ideas that you believe has the most potential for solving the identified problem</li>
            <li>Imagine how you would prototype or test the idea</li>
            <li>Develop a low fidelity prototype, mock-up, or outline a plan for how you would test the idea in a real-world context.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What to post?</h3>
        <p>
            Description, sketches, or photos of the prototype or testing idea.

        <h2>My Prototype Idea</h2>
        <h3>Establish a dedicated online support team</h3>
        <p>This idea was chosen for its direct focus on providing timely assistance and guidance to users encountering technical difficulties, directly addressing one of the primary frustrations outlined in the POV statement. Sheridan already provided support via the office of registration but this help isn't available 24/7 and from my personal experience as an international student who had to deal with the student center while I was not in Canada I find it to be a tremendous and uncomfortable experience to contact the office.</p>
        <h3>Prototyping and Testing Plan</h3>
        <p>To prototype the idea of establishing a dedicated online support team, I would start by selecting a small team of support agents trained to handle technical issues and provide guidance to students. I would then develop an online platform or chatbot accessible through Sheridan College's student center website, allowing students to easily reach out for assistance at any time. The prototype would involve testing the responsiveness and effectiveness of the support team in addressing user queries and technical difficulties. Additionally, I would collect feedback from students about their experience with the online support service to identify areas for improvement.</p>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            To evaluate the success of the idea, I would look for feedback and metrics indicating improved user satisfaction and reduced frustration with the student center platform. Metrics such as the average response time to user inquiries, the percentage of issues resolved satisfactorily, and overall user satisfaction ratings would be key indicators of the online support team's effectiveness. Additionally, monitoring the frequency of technical difficulties reported by students and comparing it to pre-implementation levels would help assess the impact of the dedicated online support service on system reliability and user experience.
