        </h1>
        <h2>Activity 1:Spotting a Problem  in the Real World</h2>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <p>
            <br>Pick a location to observe in your community. It could be a park, grocery store, workplace
            <br>, during your commute, or even within your home. Look for a problem that is complex and 
            <br>ambiguous and would be a good candidate for a problem-solving methodology. 
            <br><br>Record what takes place when you notice the problem. 

        </p>
        <h3>What to post?</h3>
        <p>
            <br>Describe your observations, along with proof that you've done the activity (a picture of your 
            <br>handwritten field note, your transcript, a picture of the issue, etc.). Refrain from identifying 
            <br>specific individuals and strive to preserve confidentiality. Include the following: 
        </p>
        <p>
            • Who experiences the problem
            <br>• Where and when you witnessed the problem
            <br>• Why do you think it is a problem worth solving
        </p>

        <h2>My Observation</h2>
        <h3>Who experiences the problem?: Me</h3>
        <h3>Where and hen did you witness the problem?: Before heading to the campus and before heading back home.</h3>
        <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            The Oakville Transit App is an app published by Oakville Transit. It isn't a navigation app but a bus-tracking app which I find difficult to <br>
            understand how it functions even though I consider myself to be quite tech-savvy (frontend developer background and I'm also a tech <br>
            lover). This app took a lot longer than I would like to get used to but that is not a major problem, the major problem for me lies in the fact<br> 
            that even though the bus tracking feature of the app works fine most of the time. The estimated arrival time of the bus is not consistent <br>
            at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is supposed to show the estimated arrival time for the selected stop, but from time to time it will not show the estimated arrival<br> 
            time of the next bus even though after checking an official schedule from Oakville there are supposed to be more buses arriving at<br> 
            the time. This causes me anxiety, frustration, and time during planning the commute. Especially, during this winter semester when exposure<br>
            to unnecessary cold air can cause many health problems which can affect my academic performance.<br>

        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think problem is worth solving</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, I think this problem is worth solving because it can cause many health problems which can affect my academic<br>
            performance. Solving this problem will help improve my anxiety during travel along with my workflow since I don't have to spend too<br>
            much time researching and switching between too many applications. Solving this problem can also help prevent the risk of getting sick<br>
            due to exposure to low temperatures during this winter semester.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I chose this particular problem because I find this problem to be quite significant in terms of improving my daily life routine, workflow,<br>
            and help decreasing the risks of getting sick in a specific season.<br>
